        "This notebook explores Agentic AI through structured examples, showcasing how AI agents plan, retrieve data, and execute tasks autonomously. Using `LangChain` and `CrewAI`, the notebook demonstrates key abstractions, including datasets, prompts, model selection, agent-based reasoning, and task execution. Examples range from structured data retrieval using Hugging Face datasets to interactive AI agents that process information and act independently. By the end, you'll see how these frameworks power AI-driven decision-making and automation, making AI applications more adaptive and autonomous."

The Game Master generates real-time trivia questions, the contestants respond independently, and the Judge evaluates and declares the winner. The flow function ensures data moves correctly between agents, orchestrating a fair and competitive game.\n",
